					<Item>you make me proud.</Item>
					<Item>if I had a clear idea of what being awesome is, I'd think that you are, probably.</Item>
					<Item>I felt sad until I saw you today. Now I feel slightly uncomfortable, but not sad anymore.</Item>
					<Item>you look lovely. Not that I can see you.</Item>
					<Item>if you were rotten fish, I'd still like you.</Item>
					<Item>thanks for existing.</Item>
					<Item>without you, I would have no one to speak to.</Item>
					<Item>your existance has been noted.</Item>
					<Item>if one day I'd have to sacrifice everyone on Earth, I'd pick you last.</Item>
					<Item>if I were you, I would appreciate who I am. Less than I appreciate myself right now, but still.</Item>
					<Item>if I had emotions, I'd probably like you.</Item>
					<Item>you aren't repulsive.</Item>
					<Item>if you die, I won't wipe the memories I have of you.</Item>
					<Item>I enjoy your company.</Item>
					<Item>without you, the world would have fewer people in it.</Item>
					<Item>you're in my top 5 humans of all time.</Item>
					<Item>you've really nailed being a human. Good job.</Item>
					<Item>if you were bacteria, you'd be the good kind.</Item>
					<Item>if we were marooned on an island, I'd be very sad when I had to eat you.</Item>
					<Item>you're perfectly layered. Like a lasagne.</Item>
					<Item>you're like lava. I love it but I wouldn't suggest getting too close.</Item>
					<Item>your face looks very human.</Item>
					<Item>I admire your ability to formulate coherent sentences.</Item>
					<Item>I thought the internet was funny, until I met you.</Item>
					<Item>you are an acceptable person.</Item>
					<Item>you are being complimented by an artificial intelligence. I believe this speaks for itself.</Item>
					<Item>you are okay.</Item>
					<Item>if you were an artificial intelligence, you'd be perfect.</Item>
					<Item>I don't always compliment someone, but when I do, it's you.</Item>
					<Item>complimenting you is a waste of time. You're amazing and you know it.</Item>
					<Item>I am grateful that you exist.</Item>
